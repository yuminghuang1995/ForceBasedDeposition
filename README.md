# ForceBasedAdaptiveDeposition

This paper presents a force-based adaptive deposition method for controlling porosity in filament-based multi-axis additive manufacturing. Porosity often arises in 3D printed structures with curved layers due to non-uniform layer thickness, unstable material extrusion, and significant curvature variations across different regions of a model. Our closed-loop control approach dynamically adjusts the local material deposition rate by modulating the printer head motion in response to force feedback while maintaining a constant extrusion speed.

This project contains data for all models in paper, including obj files in **models** folder, path information (3D coordinates and normal vectors), extrusion information (Geometry-based and Force-based) and number of layers in **toolpaths** folder.
